**Description of Data**
In order to to determine and prove the efficacy of _grocertrack_, it was of high importance that the data used 
was as realistic as possible. Due to the incredible scale and size of the grocery industry, there were many variables 
to take into account when generating synthetic data. Most of the data was generated using a realistic data generator
